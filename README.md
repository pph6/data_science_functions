# Functions
A few statistical and data science functions, written in Python (Jupyter Notebook).
<br>
This document will outline the guidelines, definitions, and parameters of the functions I have written in this repository. 


## 1. Empirical Random Variable: `empRV`
What I expect this function to do:
  - Take in one input argument that represents a dataset in the form of a 1D numpy array. This array should contain a set of numbers of arbitrary size.
  - The function should return two outputs: First a 2D array with the first column being the sorted unique values in the dataset and in the 2nd column the associated probabilities. The second output should be the first moment (the expected value of this RV).
